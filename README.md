# HW 5 -- Drawing Board -- Carl Parker (cajopa) #

This assignment was really interesting. I have done any kind of graphics
programming since I was a kid playing with my Apple II+ . . . back in
the day. The idea that I could use these techniques to design custom
interfaces is intriguing.

It could be interesting to talk a little about TextView and how to
combine text with these graphics programming techniques.

For the art tab, I experimented with drawing lines by feeding an array
of points into a `for` loop.


## Resources ## 

I found Apple's View Programming Guide to provide a lot of good
background information:

## Question ##

This isn't directly related to homework topic, but it did come up for me
during the assignment:

>> How would I programmatically set the labels on my tab view controller?
