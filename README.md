# HW 5 -- Drawing Board -- Carl Parker (cajopa) #

This assignment was really interesting. I haven't done any kind of
graphics programming since I was a kid playing with my Apple II+ . . .
back in the day. The idea that I could use these techniques to design
custom interfaces is intriguing.

It could be interesting to talk a little about TextView and how to
combine text with these graphics programming techniques.

For the art tab, I experimented with drawing lines by feeding an array
of points into a `for` loop.


## Resources ##

I found Apple's View Programming Guide to provide a lot of good
background information:

I also liked the following video that is on Marty's channel from several
months ago:

## Question ##

This isn't directly related to the homework topic, but it did come up
for me during the assignment. I feel a little over reliant on Interface
Builder, I would eventually like to learn how programmatically configure
some of the things that Interface Builder is doing for me. For example:

> How would I programmatically set the labels on my tab view controller?
