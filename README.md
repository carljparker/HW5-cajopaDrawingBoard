To use a Tab View Controller, you probably need to delete the View
Controller that comes standard with the Window Controller.

The Tab View Controller comes with two tabs. To get a third, just search
for View Controller in the UI palette and drag another View Controller
out, then connect the Tab View Controller to it.
